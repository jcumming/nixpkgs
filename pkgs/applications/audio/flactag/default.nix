      A common mechanism for backing up audio cds is to extract them from the media
      into a single flac file, and embed the cue sheet into the flac file. This means
      that the cd can be exactly reproduced at a later date. 

      flactag uses the embedded CUE sheet to create a musicbrainz 'discid', and
      queries the musicbrainz server for track lists, and other album metadata.
